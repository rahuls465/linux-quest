Changes Made to Fix Blank Page Issue
=====================================

1. Package.json Updates
----------------------
- Updated React from v19.1.0 to v18.2.0
  Reason: React 19 doesn't exist yet. Using a non-existent version caused the app to fail.

- Updated react-router-dom from v7.6.1 to v6.22.1
  Reason: React Router 7 is not released yet. Version 6 is the latest stable version.

- Updated Tailwind from v4.1.7 to v3.4.1
  Reason: Tailwind 4 doesn't exist. Version 3 is the latest stable version.

- Updated Vite from v6.3.5 to v5.1.4
  Reason: Vite 6 doesn't exist. Version 5 is the latest stable version.

2. New Files Created
-------------------
a. tailwind.config.js
   Purpose: Configures Tailwind CSS to scan and process specific files in the project.
   Key features:
   - Configured content paths for HTML and React components
   - Set up theme customization capabilities
   - Enabled plugin support

b. postcss.config.js
   Purpose: Required for Tailwind CSS processing
   Key features:
   - Configured Tailwind CSS processing
   - Set up autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility

c. src/index.css
   Purpose: Main CSS file with Tailwind directives
   Content:
   - @tailwind base
   - @tailwind components
   - @tailwind utilities
   Reason: These directives are required to inject Tailwind's styles into the application

d. vite.config.js
   Purpose: Configure Vite bundler for React support
   Key features:
   - Added React plugin
   - Enabled proper JSX processing
   Reason: Without this configuration, Vite wouldn't know how to handle React components

3. File Modifications
--------------------
src/main.jsx:
- Uncommented the CSS import
  Reason: The CSS import was commented out, preventing Tailwind styles from loading

4. Dependencies Structure
------------------------
The project now uses the following key dependencies with correct versions:
- React: 18.2.0
- React DOM: 18.2.0
- React Router DOM: 6.22.1
- Vite: 5.1.4
- Tailwind CSS: 3.4.1
- PostCSS: 8.4.35
- Autoprefixer: 10.4.17

Summary of Fix
-------------
The blank page issue was primarily caused by:
1. Invalid package versions that didn't exist
2. Missing Vite configuration for React
3. Incomplete Tailwind CSS setup
4. Commented out CSS import

The fixes ensure that:
1. All packages are using valid, stable versions
2. Build tools are properly configured
3. CSS processing pipeline is correctly set up
4. All necessary imports are active

These changes together ensure that the React application can properly compile, bundle, and render its components with the correct styling.
